- Azure has the most options
- Console
    - url: https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_ProjectOxford/CognitiveServicesHub/~/SpeechServices
- If init try fails, checkout the `eng_test_basic` function call in `src/engine_azure.py`
- Also, try latest test code by going to:
    - Google: azure speech studio
    - Go to Voice Gallery
    - Try a few voices, then find the **Sample Code** tab
- First try may not have the right output, try find a sample code that saves the voice output to a file
